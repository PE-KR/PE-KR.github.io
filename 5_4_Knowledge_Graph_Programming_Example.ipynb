He opposed the RNA world hypothesis, and held that the spontaneous emergence of a molecule as complicated as RNA is highly unlikely. Instead, he proposed that life arose from some self-sustaining and compartmentalized reaction of simple molecules: \"metabolism first\" instead of \"RNA first\". This reaction would have to be able to reproduce and evolve, eventually leading to RNA.

Instead, he proposed that life arose from some self-sustaining and compartmentalized reaction of simple molecules: \"metabolism first\" instead of \"RNA first\". This reaction would have to be able to reproduce and evolve, eventually leading to RNA.
